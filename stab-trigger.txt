with a dull butter knife
with a pencil
with a piece of rusty metal rod
in the face 
with a prison shank 
with a broken beer bottle
in the ear hole with a tire iron
with a broken axe handle
with a fork
over and over and over
with great vengeance and furious anger
with a fireplace poker
with a pair of rusty scissors
because why not
because he knows what he did
for science
